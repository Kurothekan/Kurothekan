- Hello, I’m @Kurothekan
- I'm always interested in learning new ways to be creative.
- I have been trying to learn code for a long, long, obscenly long time! However I tend to get sidetracked and distracted quiet a bit.
- I'm hopeing that at some point it will stick enough for me to create a game that has been bouncing in my head for years now.
- Bye
